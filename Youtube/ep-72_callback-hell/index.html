    <h1>Callback Hell</h1>
    <p>Callback hell refers to a situation in asynchronous programming, particularly in JavaScript, where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain. This typically occurs when many asynchronous operations need to be performed in sequence, and each operation depends on the result of the previous one.</p>
    <p><b>Characteristics of Callback Hell:----</b><br>
     <b> Deeply Nested Code:</b> The code structure resembles a pyramid, with increasing indentation for each callback. <br>
     <b> Difficult Debugging:</b> Errors are hard to trace because of the nested structure. <br>
     <b>Poor Readability:</b> Understanding the logic of the code becomes challenging. <br>
     <b>Maintenance Issues:</b> Adding or modifying functionality is cumbersome and error-prone.</p>
