    <h1>Promises</h1>
    <p>A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a clean and structured way to handle asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from an API, file I/O, or performing time-based tasks like delays.</p>
    <p><b>A promise can be in one of three states:---</b><br>

      <b>Pending:</b>
      The initial state when the operation is still in progress and hasn't completed.
      Example: Waiting for a response from a server. <br>
      <b>Fulfilled:</b>
      The operation completed successfully, and a resulting value is available.
      Example: Data received from the server. <br>
      <b>Rejected:</b>
      The operation failed, and an error or reason for failure is available.
      Example: Network request failed due to a timeout.
