    <h1>Introducing Fetch API</h1>
    <p>The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface used for making network requests to servers and handling responses. It provides a simpler, more powerful, and more flexible way to perform asynchronous HTTP requests compared to the older XMLHttpRequest.</p>
    <p><b>Key Features of the Fetch API:---</b></p>
    <p><b>Promise-Based:</b>
      The Fetch API uses Promises, making it more readable and easier to work with compared to callback-based approaches.    </p>
    <p><b>Simplified Syntax:</b>
      Its syntax is concise and easy to understand for fetching resources like JSON, text, or HTML.    </p>
    <p><b>Supports Modern Features:</b>
      It supports advanced features like request and response streaming and provides options for custom headers, request methods (GET, POST, etc.), and more.    </p>
