    <h1>Getters and Setters</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, getter and setter methods are implemented using get and set keywords. These are commonly used in classes to control access to private or protected properties.</p>
    <h2>Key Points</h2>
    <p>1. Use get and set to control access to internal properties. <br>
      2. They make your code more maintainable by allowing you to add validation or computed properties later without changing the external interface. <br>
      3. You can still access private properties directly if they're not enforced by tools like #privateProperties.</p>
