    <h1>Prototypal Inheritance Using Extends and Super Keyword</h1>
    <p>Prototypes provide a powerful and efficient way to share methods and properties in JavaScript, forming the foundation for object-oriented programming in the language. Modern ES6 class syntax simplifies working with prototypes while maintaining the same behavior.</p>
    <p>
       <b>What is Prototype?</b>
      A mechanism for object inheritance in JavaScript.
      Every function has a prototype property that allows methods and properties to be shared across all instances created by that function. <br>
     <b> Prototype Chain:</b>
      When accessing a property or method, JavaScript checks the object itself first and then its prototype chain until Object.prototype or null. <br>
      <b>Benefits of Prototypes:</b>
      1. Memory Efficiency:-- Methods and properties on the prototype are shared across all instances, avoiding duplication.
      2. Dynamic Updates:-- Changes to the prototype are immediately reflected in all instances. <br>
  
    <b>  Modern JavaScript (ES6 Classes):</b>
      
      Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar for working with prototypes.
      Methods in classes are still stored in the prototype. <br>
     <b> Key Relationships:</b>
      object.__proto__ points to the constructor's prototype.
      Object.prototype is the root of the prototype chain.
