    <h1>'this' keyword in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special identifier that refers to the execution context in which a function is called. Its value depends on how and where the function is invoked.</p>
    <h2>Rules for this in JavaScript</h2>
    <p><b>Global Context (Outside Any Function):</b>
      1.In a browser: this refers to the global window object. <br>
      2.In Node.js: this refers to the global object (global), but in ES modules, it's undefined.</p>
    <p><b>Inside an Object Method:</b>
      this refers to the object the method is called on.</p>
    <p><b>Inside a Regular Function: </b>
      In non-strict mode, this refers to the global object (window in browsers).
      In strict mode, this is undefined</p>
    <p><b>Arrow Functions:</b>
      Arrow functions donâ€™t have their own this. They inherit this from their lexical scope (where they are defined).</p>
    <p>Use call, apply, or bind to explicitly control this.</p>
