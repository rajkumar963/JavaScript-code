    <p><b>Time Zone:</b> A geographic region where a uniform standard time is used, typically based on an offset from UTC. Examples include GMT and IST. <br>

       <b> GMT (Greenwich Mean Time):</b> The time at the Prime Meridian (0Â° longitude), historically the global time standard but now largely replaced by UTC. <br>
        
       <b> UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):</b> The modern global time standard, based on atomic clocks, used as a reference for all time zones.<br>
        
        <b>ISO Standard:</b> The ISO 8601 format provides an internationally accepted way to represent date and time, e.g., 2024-12-14T10:30:00Z.<br>
        
       <b> How Computers Keep Track of Time:</b> Computers use a hardware clock and synchronize system clocks with Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers for accuracy.<br>
        
       <b> Unix Time and Epoch:</b> A time representation counting seconds since January 1, 1970 (Unix Epoch), widely used in programming for its simplicity.</p>
